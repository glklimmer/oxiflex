Slow Convergence
  note that this is took from minizinc benchmarks

Slow Convergence p2
  note adjusted original n from benchmarks
  only Variable Ordering works for this in reasonable time
  say "clearly non-linear" instead of "exponentially"

Gecode
  note what gecode is
  note that this benchmark was easy due to minizinc compatability

Conclusion
  solver from scratch
  can read minizinc / flatzinc
  datastructes matter a lot
