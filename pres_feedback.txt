9/45
Also array [1..2] of int: x introduced 2 = [1,-2]; red

26/45
dynamic variable ordering
add visual aid

28/45
- add "only one solution" ability
- check floating min/max "limitation", otherwise change to same bullet point level

36/45
plots add method info (average) as caption/footnote

40/45
note that this is took from minizinc benchmarks

41/45
note adjusted original n from benchmarks
only Variable Ordering works for this in reasonable time
say "clearly non-linear" instead of "exponentially"

43/45
add title
note what gecode is
note that this benchmark was easy due to minizinc compatability

conclusion
- solver from scratch
  - can read minizinc / flatzinc

- benchmark
  - datastructes matter a lot


feedback
- move rust to beginning
  - wanted to apply rust for a serious project (first time)


backup slides
- add profiling pictures
