\chapter{Oxiflex}

As part of this thesis we present oxiflex, a minimal constraint satisfaction problem solver from scratch for MiniZinc written in rust. Oxiflex is a FlatZinc solver that can be used as an backend to MiniZinc. This means oxiflex supports the minimal requirements for a solver to take advantage of the MiniZinc toolchain.

Oxiflex is open-source and available under the MIT license under \url{https://github.com/glklimmer/oxiflex}.
