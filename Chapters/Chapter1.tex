The package comes with an option regarding the bibliography style.
You can include the package with
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[citeauthor]{basilea}
\end{verbatim}
to be able to cite authors directly with
\begin{verbatim}
\citet{turing:1950}
\end{verbatim}

If the option is enabled, then the following reference should print Turing [2]:~\citet{turing:1950}
