\chapter{Conclusion}

Obviously the whole point of this thesis and oxiflex was to showcase how much of an impact forward checking and arc consistency would make. Altough they did have an impact, sadly in the wrong direction. Enforcing arc consistency made oxiflex in some cases magnitudes slower.

forward checking faster on queens

inference improvment on iterations

a lot of benchmarking and profiling using hotspot (maybe ref)

hashmaps maybe problem?
- tried directly pairs of values in revise

Vec maybe problem?
- tried linked lists

Importance of datastructures

rust apperantly pretty fast
