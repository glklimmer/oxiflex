Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are typical NP-complete combinatorial problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence. As part of this thesis we introduce Oxiflex, a CSP solver written from scratch in Rust. Oxiflex is built on the MiniZinc tool chain and supports a subset of FlatZinc constraint builtins. Starting with a naive backtracking approach, we enhance Oxiflex by applying variable ordering and inference. Both forward checking and arc consistency enforcing algorithms like AC-1 and AC-3 are used for inference. Results show that for Oxiflex variable ordering and forward checking have a positive impact on time measurements but AC-1 and AC-3 do not. However by measuring number of iterations results show that AC-1 and AC-3 can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for backtracking. This work shows that inference does tighten the problem size, but careful implementation is needed to make it fast.
