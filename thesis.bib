  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, a brief exposition of
              the general backtrack technique and its history is given. Second,
              it is shown how the use of macros can considerably shorten the
              computation time in many cases. In particular, this technique has
              allowed the solution of two previously open combinatorial problems,
              the computation of new terms in a well-known series, and the
              substantial reduction in computation time for the solution to
              another combinatorial problem.},
